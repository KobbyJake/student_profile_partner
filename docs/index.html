          This is an academic information management system built to assist
          student of the University of Education Winneba. The aim of this
          application is to offer students more functionalities to manage
          academic information.

            <p>
              The initial user entry point is the home page. The home page has a
              number of components namely the system dashboard, the
              authentication module, the external hyperlinks and the description
              section. When the program is launched, the system dashboard in
              restricted mode. A successful user authentication changes the
              system dashboard from restricted mode to active mode. The
              description section provides brief information about each function
              on the system dashboard. The description section work when the
              system dashboard is in active mode. The page further presents the
              system login module for user authentication. The login module has
              three sub-links in addition to the ‘Sign in’ button. The sign up
              link (active in restricted mode) loads the user registration
              module for new users. The ‘Forget Password’ link activates the
              password reset module which sends new passwords to users through
              electronic mail. The ‘Sign out’ link enables the user to log out
              of a session.

              The very first objective of this project was to enable students
              maintain a list of registered courses for each semester. The
              course registration module of the Students’ Profiler Application
              works to achieve this objective. As part of preparatory activities
              required of users at the start of a semester, courses that form
              the basis for schedules and academic events must be recorded in
              the name of the user concerned. The course registration module
              comes with two sections; the registration section and the summary
              section. By checking the corresponding checkbox, a user registers
              a course for a particular semester. Optionally, the user may
              supply the name of the lecturer in charge of that particular
              course. On completing a check, the list of registered courses, the
              number of course and the total credit hours for the semester are
              automatically updated at the summary section of the registration
              screen. At the summary section, users are presented a print-out
              button to create a report of registered courses for a semester in
              portable document format (pdf).

            <p>
              Where successful students go, effective time management plays a
              crucial role. Students Profile Partner provides students the
              facility to schedule routine activities that are repeated on daily
              basis all week round and non-routine that occurs once at any
              particular time. The scheduling module comes with the scheduler
              itself and event logging system. The scheduler allows users to
              merge their personal schedules with that of the lecture schedule
              for a particular semester. The scheduling module has the input
              section where activities, venues, time and dates are specified.
              The other section is the output section where the schedule (time
              table) is displayed organized according to the days of the week..

            <p>
              The ability of students to manage information about their course
              work in the form of assignments quizzes and examinations has a
              telling influence on the performance of students. Users of this
              system having gone through course registration can create logs of
              academic activities during a particular semester. With reminder
              capabilities, logs created from the academics module enable
              students to follow closely their individual work load for any
              course in the semester. The input section has two panels; one for
              the input of assignment and the other for quizzes and
              examinations. Course, venue, date and time are the major input
              needed to create an entry in the academics module. The output
              section displays logs for a particular semester. Logs to be
              displayed can be filtered according to assignment, quiz or
              examination.

            <p>
              The responsibility of assessing the performance of students rests
              with the lecturer that take a particular course. During the
              semester, quizzes, assignments and examinations are conducted to
              determine the levels of attainment made by students in any course
              area. The climax of these activities is when students’ grades are
              published. A single grade usually does not paint a complete
              picture of a student’s performance therefore collecting all grades
              for a semester in one place makes performance monitoring easy and
              fun. The grading module of the application provides student with
              the facility to collect grades for registered courses. This module
              provides a specially designed Grade Point Average (GPA) calculator
              which is aware of courses for each semester. The grading module
              collects and stores grades obtained in each course for each
              semester. The summary section displays various information and a
              general summary of grades obtain in the semester under review.

            <img src="img/performance.png" alt="Performance screen." />
            <p>
              The performance module of the application is closely tied to the
              grading module. The performance module like the grading module
              presents summary of the grades obtained as well as cumulative
              summery of performances accumulated from other semesters. The
              performance module organizes and presents students’ grades without
              the ability to change grade as found in the grading module. Based
              on the cumulative grades, the performance module determines the
              class the student will attain when the student graduates. A
              statistical feature in the performance module visualizes students’
              performance by plotting bar charts and line graphs with semesters
              against Grade Point Averages (GPAs) or Semesters against
              Cumulative Grade Point Averages (CGPAs). In addition to the
              visualization of performances, the student is given the avenue to
              generate reports on their performances.

            <img src="img/wallet.png" alt="Wallet Screen." />
            <p>
              The wallet module of the system helps the student to create
              monitory logs. The student’s ability to monitor his or her own
              spending during times spent on campus is equally important as far
              as students’ information management goes. The system provides
              students with the avenue to log all financial inflows and outflow.
              The input section of the module helps organize logs under income
              or expenditure. Other input details include title, amount, date,
              time and comments. The output section displays logs and has
              filters for income only and expenditure only. The output section
              further displays total income as well as total expenditure.

            <p>
              Records keeping even at students’ level is not a trivial job.
              Records such as payment of fees are always backed by document in
              the form of receipts or payment vouchers. On the course work
              front, collection of registration print-outs and course outlines
              are a few of important documents that must be kept by students all
              the time. Students’ Profile Partner comes with the document module
              that assists students to store soft copies of important document
              for future use. The input section has a title input, a file
              chooser, a section selector and comments. The output is a list of
              saved documents. On selecting an item from the output list, a user
              can click on the retrieve button to retrieve the referenced
              document from file storage into a pre-determined directory on the
              user’s computer. Document storage is also organized into semesters
              just like all other modules in the system.

            <img src="img/settings.png" alt="Settings screen" />
            <p>
              The settings module has three components; instructions, personal
              details and general settings. The instructions component provides
              information about how to use the other two components. The pesonal
              details component enables users to make changes to their personal
              information collected when the user signed up. Key among the
              details is password reset where users can change their existing
              passwords. The third component is general settings from which
              users can specify output folder where reports and document will be
              kept. The general settings also provides avenues for performing
              database backup and restore operations. Other settings include
              specifying details of the current semester across the entire
              system.
